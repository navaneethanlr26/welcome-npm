# Overview

# The Software Utility Marketplace is designed to be a centralised hub for accessing and sharing various software   utilities and APIs.Initially, the platform will offer a curated selection of utilities developed by us, but the long-term goal is to open it up for public contributions, allowing anyone to publish their utilities.

# Features

# UI Framework: The platform utilises Material UI as a base with the option to incorporate custom components.
# Rate Limiting: Rate limiting is implemented based on usage plans to ensure fair usage.
# Sample App Kit: Developers are provided with a kit to create sample applications for their utilities.
# Managed Apps: Utilities developed within the platform must adhere to NodeJS Version 21 or higher and have CI/CD setup for seamless deployment.
# Developer Portal: A developer portal allows users to create new apps, automatically generating sample apps with CI/CD setup.
# iFrame Applications: Developers have the flexibility to create applications in any language and host them outside of the marketplace while adhering to UI design guidelines.


# Contributing

# To upload an app to the marketplace, developers must follow these steps:

# Create Docker Image: Developers must package their utility or API into a Docker image.

# Push to GitHub: Use the provided link to push the Docker image to the designated GitHub repository.
